# pipeorgan
3D designs for PVC pipe organ based on recorder design. 

The core concept of this project is to prepare a generic organ type that can utilize standard components.  This design utilizes the following fan:

There are two components in the design:  

1. Fan caddy
2. Labium for PVC pipes

The fan caddy is designed to support a 12V fan which is commonly used for 3D printers.  This funnels the air into the Labium piece.

The design is based upon the recorder labium design.  The associated spreadsheet drives a number of sizing comparisons so it can be adjusted to larger or smaller pipes as well as lengths of the sections.

Current issue is the fillet on the air opening cannot be created without error.  In previous designs, this was resolved by ensuring the fillet was created prior to subsequent section additions.  Unfortunately, it is likely I will need to do this to resolve in the future.
